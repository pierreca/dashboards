This repository contains command line utilites that I feel are fun to use for github and jenkins.
It's more of a personal experiment than a real project. It should probably be two separate repositories too. Meh.

See the specifc readme files for both projects:

- [github](./github/README.md)
- [jenkins](./jenkins/README.md)
