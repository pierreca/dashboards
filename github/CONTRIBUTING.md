## How to contribute to this project? 

Thanks for the interest! I would indeed appreciate contributions. What is paramount right now is not adding features but rather stabilizing the existing stuff, squash bugs,
and prepare for the next generation of features and refactoring to be more testable. Also, I'd love to get better docs and more helpful error messages.

I know, this is the boring stuff. Sorry. I'm working on it too :)

Obviously if you find bugs, errors, unclear instructions, feel free to open an issue. If you feel like you can fix it, submit a pull request. I'll take (or write) as many small changes
as possible. If your pull request is about changing the coding style, rearchitecturing a component completely, or some other massive change though, It's likely that I'll set it aside
for now, the time to clean the project. Don't feel bad. I'll get to it. 

You want a new, killer feature? probably even think the tool doesn't make sense without it? I hear you. fork the repo, work from your fork. I can't say I'll pull though, 
because the priority is docs, test, and user experience right now. I take all feedback seriously though, so by all means, let me know what you're up to :). 

Thanks!
